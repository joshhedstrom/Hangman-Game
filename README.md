# Hangman Game

A JavaScript hangman game

I built this game for a homework assignment. I decided to go with a topical style of hangman so it would be more enjoyable to play.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback! I'd love to hear it! Email me at josh.hedstrom [at] gmail.com, or find me on twitter @josh_hedstrom

Cheers!
