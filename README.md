# Hangman-Game
A JavaScript hangman game

I built this game for a homework assignment. I decided to go with a topical style of hangman so it would be more enjoyable to play.

As of 3/3/17, it does not work on mobile devices because javscript won't recognize keyup events from a mobile keyboard, but I'm working on that.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback! I'd love to hear it! Email me at josh.hedstrom@gmail.com, or find me on twitter @josh_hedstrom

Cheers!
